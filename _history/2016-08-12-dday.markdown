introduction: "On the 6th of June 1944, Allied troops landed ashore at strategic
points in Normandy as part of operation Overlord to liberate German-occupied 
Western Europe. The Normandy landings are considered the largest seaborne invasion
in history of humankind. The region is now a site of invaluable cultural heritage,
where it is possible to visit museums of the Second World War, bunkers that formed
the coastal defenses of the Third Reich and first and foremost, the beaches where
Americans, British, Canadians, Norwegians came ashore with nearly 5000 landing and 
assault crafts. Here I have collected the most relevant pictures I have taken
when visiting Normandy together with a brief explanation of what they portray."
