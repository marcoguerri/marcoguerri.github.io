I was born in Modena, Italy, and I studied Computer Engineering at University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. I currently work at Meta as a Production Engineer. I have been based in the Dublin office for slightly more than 4 years and I am now full remote. You can get in touch by dropping me an email at <a class="u-email" href="mailto:punk.water9156@fastmail.com">punk.water9156@fastmail.com</a>.
