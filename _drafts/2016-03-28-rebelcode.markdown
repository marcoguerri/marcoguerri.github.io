intro: "This book by Glyn Moody is a great overview of the history of Open Source from
the early '90s to the beginning of the new century. It presents the various topics
from a purely historical perspective and it covers more or less all the most
important players that contributed to shape the Open Source world."

The journey sets out at the beginning of the '90s, even though Moody first quickly outlines
the difficult times Microsoft was facing between 1998 and 1999, with the 
antitrust lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice and the continuous
delays in the release of Windows 2000, the company's flagship operating system.
In this context, the [Halloween Documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents){:target="_blank"}
contributed to disclose the serious hardship the company was going through internally.
This is somehow a flash-forward into the result of a revolution that was started
around ten years earlier. In fact, in 1990 the situation looked very much different,
and Microsoft was steadily dominating the desktop market with Windows 3.1,
Visual Basic, Excel and Word.
