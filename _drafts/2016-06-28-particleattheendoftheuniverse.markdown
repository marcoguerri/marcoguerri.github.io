The Universe can be reduced to four main interactions: electromagnetism,
gravitational force, strong and weak interactions. Every interaction occurs by
means of its own exchange particle(s). In mid 19th century, Scottish physicist
James Clerk Maxwell demonstrates that electricity and magnetism are connected and
that the relationship between them can be expressed in terms of four equations.
In early 1900, physicists realize that electromagnetic phenomena involve the exchange
of photons between charged particles. The most recent and successful attempt
to unify the four forces has been the work done by Steven Winber, Sheldon Glashow 
and Adbus Salam, who proposed the theory of <b>electroweak unification</b>, also known
as <b>Standard Model</b>. Physicists
have also tried to explain the asymmetry between force carriers, like photons and
the carriers of the weak interaction: the former are massless, while the latter
are massive. The theory is that at the beginning all the forces were balanced,
and that at some point the symmetry was broken. 
\\
The most famous mechanism for
symmetry breaking is based on the <b>Higgs field</b>, proposed in 1964 by British
physicist Peter Higgs. In the early moments of the universe, the breaking of
symmetry caused a true vacuum with lowest energy value zero to become a false
vacuum, with lowest energy value non-zero. Following Einstein's law, the energy 
became mass and was shared among elementary particles. The Higgs boson, the carrier
of the Higgs field, can be observed only during high energy particle events.
\\
Electroweak and strong forces can be explained well in terms of quantum mechanics,
while the general theory of relativity gives a precise and deterministic description
    of gravity. 
\\
Particles are split in two families <b>hadrons</b> (e.g. protons) and <b>leptons</b>
(e.g. electrons). The former are subject to the strong force, while the latter are not.
Hadrons are composed of quarks, bound together by gluons. The are six types of
quarks and six types of antiquarks. The Top Quark was identified in 1995 by
the Tevatron and Fermilab. In 1993, US cut off funding for what would have been
the biggest accelerator, the <b>Superconducting Super Collider</b> (up to 40TeV).
In September 2008, proton beams circulated inside the LHC. After 9 days of operation,
a faulty electrical connection between two magnets heated up causing the supercooled helium
to vaporize (superconducting magnets re-acquire resistance if not kept close to
absolute zero). The flood of helium slammed into the magnets, jostled them out of position
and destroyed the beam pipe.

John Dalton was the first to use the word atom in the modern sense, the smallest
component of a chemical element that conveys its properties. Later, <b>Thomas Thomson</b>,
arranged atoms in order of their relative weights. <b>Michael Faraday</b> was the first to
propose the concept of electric and magnetic fields as intermediaries that enable
electric and magnetic forces to be conveyed through space. Maxwell later came to
the conclusion that electromagnetism is light. In 1880, German physicist 
<b>Heinrich Hertz</b> constructed a transmitter that produced electromagnetic
waves of frequencies lower than infrared. He also confirmed that they were unseen forms of 
light. <b>Maxwell equations make no provision for the velocity of the observer</b>, light
has always the same speed. Einstein special theory of relativity, 1905, cleared
up this problem by modifying Newtonian mechanics adding factors that stretch out
time and shrink space for travellers moving close to the speed of light (<b>time dilation</b>
and <b>length contraction</b>). Einstein also revised the concept of mass: relativistic
mass depends on the object's velocity. The higher the velocity, the higher the mass.
\\
In 1900, <b>Max Planck</b> introduces the concept of quanta, the discrete package
through which light irradiates its energy, in contract with the classic wave
picture of light which imagines it delivering energy proportional to its
brightness (addressing a problem known as <b>ultraviolet disaster</b>). According
to
Maxwell, light comes in discrete packets called quanta, the amount of energy being
proportional to the frequency. Energy is channeled towards lower frequencies,
eliminating the ultraviolet catastrophe. Einstein integrated quantum theory in the
photoelectric effect, which explains how electrons are released when light shines on
a metal. In 1915, Einstein translated the theory of gravity into Minkowski's
framework of <b>space-time</b>, where matter can bend space-time forcing objects
to follow curved paths: this is the <b>general theory of relativity</b>.
\\
Forces are conveyed by means of exchange particles, bosons, which cause attraction,
repulsion or transformation. W+ and W- are carriers of the weak force, they
are massive and electrically charged. < boson is also a carrier of the weak force,
but it's neutral.
\\
String theory is another famous unification mode, which instead of particles 
envisions minuscule vibrating strands of energy. The problem is that it encompasses
myriad of physically unrealistic configurations. It includes all known interactions,
so it's called "theory of everything". String configurations correspond to
masses/spins/properties of various types of constituents. String theory is difficult
to test experimentally because it is consistent only in a world of ten dimensions.
Unification of all the natural forces would have taken place at very high
energies just factions of seconds after the Big Bang, so it's unlikely that the LHC
would lead to results which either confirm or disprove string theory.
\\
<b>Ernest Rutherford</b> anticipated Marconi's wireless telegraph by constructing 
a radio transmitter and receiver. Rutherford started to work at the Cavendish
Laboratory under Thomson's supervision, who previously discovered that cathode rays' mass
was much smaller that the one of ionized hydrogen. These much smaller particles
would be later called electrons. Radiation was discovered in 1896 by <b>Henri
Becquerel</b> in Paris. <b>Marie and Pierre Curie</b>, also working in Paris, confirmed
his findings on Uranium extending the theory to Radium and Polonium. They
all received the Nobel prize in 1903. Rutherford discovered that radioactive material
produce positive and negative radiation, which he called alpha and beta radiation.
Gamma radiation was discovered later. With alpha and beta radiations, the number of protons
and neutrons in the nucleus alters, resulting in a different element, while with gamma
decay the quantity stays the same. Rutherford worked to discover the nature
of alpha radiation, finding its weight to be identical to that of helium ions.
Later, he moved to Manchester with the idea of revealing the content of the atom
by using alpha particles (his idea was to put Thomson's model to the test). The
experiment consisted in bombarding a foil of gold registering the deviation of
alpha particles, and it was carried out by Geiger and Marsden. In the light of the results
of the experiments, the idea of a positively charged nucleus was introduced.
\\
Some of the questions left unanswered by Rutherford were addressed by <b>Niels Bohr</b>. Bohr
introduced the idea that electrons vibrate only at particular values of energy, 
a multiple of Planck's constant (quantum state). This would allow electrons not 
to collapse on the nucleus. Jumps to one quantum state or the other result
in the gain or loss of energy and the emission of a photon with a specific energy.
This perfectly explained the spectral lines of the hydrogen. <b>Heisenberg</b>
later developed a model that explained the probability of an electron jumping
from a quantum state to another. He introduced the laws of quantum mechanics,
were position and momentum cannot be measured at the same time. In 1926,
<b>Schrodinger</b> proposed the theory of wave mechanics, where wave functions
defines distribution of probability of an electron being in different points in
space. Heisenberg's and Schrodinger's descriptions are completely equivalent.
