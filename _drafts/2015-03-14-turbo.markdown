According to Intel documentation, softwares that use ACPI structure to match the current
performance state with the core frequency are not reliable when Turbo mode kicks in
(P0 performance state).

Most currently available software that calculates frequency relies on the ACPI 
P-state structures that are provided by the BIOS or calls an application programming 
interface (API) that relies on these structures. The ‘frequency’ field in the
P0 ACPI _PSS object does not reflect actual Intel® Turbo Boost technology frequencies. 
Instead, it always shows the P0 frequency as P1 frequency plus 1 MHz. Due to this, 
software that uses the P-state structures, directly or indirectly, will not
properly display Intel® Turbo Boost technology frequencies.
