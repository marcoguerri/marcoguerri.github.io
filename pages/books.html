    Despite being by no means an avid reader, among the activities I enjoy reading is 
    certainly one worth writing few lines about. I mainly read books related to
    science, computers, history and I really love horror novels. The main idea 
    of this section is to collect some ideas and recommendations about interesting 
    readings.
