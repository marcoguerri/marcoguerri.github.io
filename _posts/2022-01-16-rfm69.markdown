Summary
=======
I setup a RFM69 tranceiver on 433 MHz band, and interfaced it with a Nooelec SDR.
This posts explains how the transceiver modulates
and encodes data, and how the SDR receives and decodes the signal.
=======


For the SPI communication analysis, I used a cheap logic analyzer.


Be careful to not establish ground loops. In this case everything was
connected through the USB bus, so the risk was basically 0.
