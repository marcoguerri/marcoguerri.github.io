Summary
=======
I recently setup a RFM69 tranceiver on 433 MHz band, and interfaced it with a Nooelec SDR.
This posts explains how the transceiver modulates and encodes data, and how the SDR and `rtl_433`
receive and decode the signal.


Transmission
=======


Demodulation and decoding
=======
We know our signal is modulated as `OOK`, and data is transmitted by RFM69 at 1kbit, with a 1ms bit period which is independent
of the bit value. This signal can be demodulated with the `OOK_PCM`, provided we give `short`, `long`, `reset` parameters, which
we'll explain later:

{% highlight text %}
$ rtl_433 g002_434M_250k.cu8  -R 0 -X 'n=rfm69,m=OOK_PCM,s=1000,l=1000,r=100000'

{% endhighlight %}


With OOK modulation, binary data is represented as the 433 MHz carrier being present or absent. RTL2832U, which my
SDR receiver is based on, outputs 8-bit I/Q-samples. The default sampling frequency used by `rtl_433` is 250kHZ,
which audacity visualizes as follows:

![](/img/rfm69/Audacity.png)


The two channels shown above represents the I and Q samples, which are identical because [TODO: reason].
`rtl_433` first translates the I/Q samples into a pulse train, e.g. a sequence of `pulse[n]` and `gap[b]` numbers, each
representing the width, in number of samples, of either the pulse (presence of the carrier) or the gap (absence of
the carrier) at position `n` in the sequence. The RFM69 transmits at 1kbit, with a 1ms bit period which is independent
of the bit value being transmitted. The `PCM` demodulator needs to know how to extract bits in the pulse train, in particular
through the following parameters:

* `short` is the nominal width of the pulse, i.e. the duration of the presence of the carrier which signals a value of 1 or 0
* `long` is the nominal width of the bit period, which might not necessarily correspond to `short` bit.
* `reset` the maximum gap length before it's considered end of message


The data produced by `OOK_PCM` demodulator seems to be matching what we would expect: we have a pre-amble (`aaaaaaaa`) and a sync world (`2dd4`)
as expected. What follows definitely does not correspond to what we transmitted, because the transceiver transforms data post demodulation with a 
whitening process. What initially did not add up was the output of the pulse analyzer (`-A` flag), whose output was the following:

which was initially identical to the correct one, but was diverging from byte 12th onwards. The sequence encoded in the URL query string
is in RfRaw format, which is defined as part of a command supported by the [Portisch](https://github.com/Portisch/RF-Bridge-EFM8BB1) open source firmware
for the Sonoff RF bridge. The Portisch firmware itself runs on the RF chip, while the the [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) project includes
also the firmware for the ESP on the Sonoff device. The wiki [explains](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/Sonoff-RF-Bridge-433/#learning-commands-with-portisch-firmware) how commands are built,
but it's more interesting to look at `rtl_433` code.



The `RfRaw` command is built based on the pulse/gap sequence calculated initially by `rtl_433`,
which is then merged into a histogram of bins containing the duration in `us` of a pulse/gap
event. These bins are then referred by the data in the command, creating a dictionary-based
compressed sequence. The bins collected from pulse and gaps might look for example like the 
following:

{% highlight text %}
Bin 1000.000000
Bin 1992.000000
Bin 3000.000000
Bin 4008.000000
Bin 7656.000000
Bin 6004.000000
Bin 80164.000000
{% endhighlight %}

and a sequence of (pulse, gap) pairs:

{% highlight text %}
504, 245
754, 247
254, 746
1503, 246
754, 247
504, 745
254, 246
255, 494
255, 246
255, 245
255, 745
1004, 20041
{% endhighlight %}

As seen before, those numbers represent the amount of samples for a specific pulse or gap.
Given the 250kHZ sampling frequency, 250 samples would represent 1ms, which is also our bit
time. What gets transmitted as `RfRaw` command are the references to the bins, which are
themselves encoded at the beginning of the sequence:

|----------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Pulse/gap** | **Bin reference** | **Bin encoding** |
|----------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| 504,245      | Bin indexes 1, 0    | 0x90 |
| 754, 247  | Bin indexes 2, 0 | 0xA0 |
| 254, 746 | Bin indexes 0, 2 | 0x82 |
| 1503, 246 | Bin indexes 5,0 | 0xD0 |
| 754, 247 | Bin indexes 2,0 | 0xA0 |
| 504, 745 | Bin indexes 1,2 | 0x92|
| 254, 246 | Bin indexes 0,0 | 0x80 |
| 255, 494 | Bin indexes 0,1 | 0x81 |
| 255, 246 | Bin indexes 0,0 | 0x80 |
| 255, 245 | Bin indexes 0,0 | 0x80 |
| 255, 745 | Bin indexes 0,2 | 0x82 |
| 1004, 20041 | Bin indexes 3,6 | 0xB6 |

The bins and references combined together yield the last portion of the query string, i.e:
AAB01C070103E807C80BB80FA81DE81774FFFF**90A082D0A0928081808082B655**

Knowing how the `RfRaw` encoding happens, we can try to find where the analyzed sequences
starts diverging from the expected one.
