All the forces that steer the Universe can be reduce to four main interactions: 
electormagnetism, gravitational force, strong and weak interaction. 

One of the
most relevant attempts to unify these forces into a single explanation in the work
done by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell in mid-nineteenth century, when
he demonstrated that electricity and magnetism are connected and that the relationship
between the two of them can be expressed in terms of four equations.  

The latest and most successful attempt to unify all the four foundamental laws
has been the melding of electromagnetism and the weak force, performed by American
physicists Steven Weinberg and Sheldon Glashow and Pakistani physicist Abdus Salam.
This is known as the electroweak interaction. However, at the beginning there
were many obscure details. Particles involved in electromagnetic and weak exchanges
are significantly different in terms of masses and physicists in the 20th century
have tried to find an explanantion to this disparity. 


This inequality was probably generated from an initial symmetry in the universe, 
where all forces were perfectly balanced. The most famous mechanism proposed 
that would explain this symmetry breaking is based on the Higgs field, 
introduced by British physicist Peter Higgs in 1964. It basically explains how,
during the nascent moments of the universe, energy was transformed into massive 
particles leaving at the same time photons massless.
