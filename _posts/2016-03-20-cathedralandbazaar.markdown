intro:  "The Cathedral and the Bazaar was written by Eric Raymond at the end 
of the '90s in the form of an essay, and it was published in 1999 as part of a 
larger collection of writings from Raymond himself that was named after the 
title of its first and foremost part, precisely \"The Cathedral and the Bazaar\". 
The book has become a widely known classic 
on the complex mechanisms that regulate software development and software engineering, 
especially from the point of view of the Open Source community. No wonder why 
this book has become a classic of computer science literature: it's an extremely 
informative and thorough analysis of a topic that is often overlooked when it 
comes to software, that is, how people work and collaborate."

The Hacker culture had its origins at the MIT Railroad club, at the beginning of the
'60s, at the time of the adoption of the <b>DEC PDP-1, 1961</b>. Few years later,
in <b>1967, the DEC PDP-10</b> was adopted. MIT develops its own OS for he PDP-10,
the Incompatible Time Sharing, written in Assembly and running software written mostly
Lisp. In <b>1969, ARPANET</b> was
launched, the first packet switched network consisting of  universities and research institutes.
In the same year, Ken Thomson and Dennis Ritchie (who had been working on Multics for
Bell Labs at AT&T), wrote Unix. The C Language was specifically created for use under Unix
(and to write Unix itself!). Workhorse machines of early Unix culture where the <b>PDP-11</b>
and <b>VAX</b>. At the beginning of the '80s, the three main cultures on the scene were:
 
 * PDP-10, Incompatible Time Sharing and Lisp
 * PDP-11, Unix and C
 * Early personal computer adopters (IBM 5550 was introduced in 1983)

Unix started to be licenced by AT&T to third parties at the end of the '70s, leading
to a large ecosystem of academic and proprietary versions. The <b>Berkley variant of Unix, BSD, </b> 
running on VAX became the hacking system par excellence. In 1984, Unix became 
a supported AT&T product and the whole decade was basically marked by the rivalry 
between Berkley Unix and AT&T version. Richard Stallman started to write a Unix 
clone in C in 1982, GNU, mainly to create a software strictly linked to the
four essential freedoms listed in the GNU Manifesto.   

As of the beginning of 1990, the workstation market started to be threatened by personal 
computers based on the Intel 386 processor. Individual hackers could afford such 
machines, but the software landscape was not in good shape. Commercial Unixes were still expensive: some
companies attempted to distribute AT&T or BSD Unix ports for PC-class machines, but 
success was extremely scarce. Sources were not distributed with the OS, and this
was clearly not what hackers wanted. The fragmented landscape of proprietary Unix
version failed to compete with Microsoft's Windows OS, which, albeit inferior,
grabbed a large share of the market.
