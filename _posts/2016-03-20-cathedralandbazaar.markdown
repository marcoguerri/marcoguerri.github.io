The Cathedral and the Bazaar was written by Eric Raymond at the end 
of the '90s in the form of an essay, and it was published in 1999 as part of a 
larger collection of writings from the same author that was named after the 
title of its first and foremost part, precisely "The Cathedral and the Bazaar". 
The book has become a widely known classic 
on the complex mechanisms that regulate software development and software engineering, 
especially from the point of view of the Open Source community. No wonder why 
this book has become a classic of computer science literature: it's an extremely 
informative and thorough analysis of a topic that is often overlooked when it 
comes to software, that is, how people work and collaborate. 
<br>
The first part consists of an historical perspective of the origins of the hacker
culture, named "A Brief History of Hackerdom". This is a super interesting overview
of some of the decades that gave birth to computer science, from the moment MIT
adopted the DEC PDP-1 in 1969 to the early '80s, when three different culture
where coexisting together: the PDP-10/Incompatible Time Sharing people,
the PDP-11/Unix folks and the early personal computer enthusiasts (the IBM 5150
was launched in 1981). But it does not stop there, it goes as far as the '90s, 
the years of the 386 and the beginning of the GNU/Linux revolution.
<br>
The Cathedral and the Bazaar comes immediately next. The title of the essay
is a provocative juxtaposition of two terms that identify two different software
development approaches: the closed source model, the cathedral, and the open source
one, the bazaar. Raymond presents first his experience as a software developer (mostly
related to fetchmail) and starts analyzing the forces that steer open source 
software development. Why projects are started, what are the condition for 
them to be "done right", how human resources relate to the process 
and last but not least, an in-depth reasoning on the role and necessity of 
management in software projects. If you are curious to know why "Joy is an asset", 
then this essay is a must read.
