intro:  "The Cathedral and the Bazaar was written by Eric Raymond at the end 
of the '90s in the form of an essay, and it was published in 1999 as part of a 
larger collection of writings from Raymond himself that was named after the 
title of its first and foremost part, precisely \"The Cathedral and the Bazaar\". 
The book has become a widely known classic 
on the complex mechanisms that regulate software development and software engineering, 
especially from the point of view of the Open Source community. No wonder why 
this book has become a classic of computer science literature: it's an extremely 
informative and thorough analysis of a topic that is often overlooked when it 
comes to software, that is, how people work and collaborate."

The Hacker culture had its origins at the MIT Railroad club, at the beginning of the
'60s, at the time of the adoption of the <b>DEC PDP-1, 1961</b>. Few years later,
in <b>1967, the DEC PDP-10</b> was adopted. MIT develops its own OS for he PDP-10,
the Incompatible Time Sharing, written in Assembly and running software written mostly
Lisp. In <b>1969, ARPANET</b> was
launched, the first packet switched network consisting of  universities and research institutes.
In the same year, Ken Thomson and Dennis Ritchie (who had been working on Multics for
Bell Labs), wrote Unix. The C Language was specifically created for use under Unix
(and to write Unix itself!). Workhorse machines of early Unix culture where the <b>PDP-11</b>
and <b>VAX</b>. At the beginning of the '80s, the three main cultures on the scene were:
 
 * PDP-10, Incompatible Time Sharing and Lisp
 * PDP-11, Unix and C
 * Early personal computer adopters (IBM 5550 was introduced in 1983)

Richard Stallman started to write a Unix clone in C in 1982.
