intro:  "The Cathedral and the Bazaar was written by Eric Raymond at the end 
of the '90s in the form of an essay, and it was published in 1999 as part of a 
larger collection of writings from Raymon himself that was named after the 
title of its first and foremost part, precisely \"The Cathedral and the Bazaar\". 
The book has become a widely known classic 
on the complex mechanisms that regulate software development and software engineering, 
especially from the point of view of the Open Source community. No wonder why 
this book has become a classic of computer science literature: it's an extremely 
informative and thorough analysis of a topic that is often overlooked when it 
comes to software, that is, how people work and collaborate."
