About
=====
I was born in Modena, Italy, too many years ago. I studied Computer Engineering 
at University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and I currently work at CERN, the 
European Organization for Nuclear Research.

The usefulness of this blog is highly questionable. This is meant to be mostly a place
for myself, a place where to dump ideas and experiments in a slightly more formal
way than it would normally happen on my notebook (yeah, old school).

<div id='email'>I would recommend using public key encryption, especially when communicating via email,
even if the content of the message would normally be considered as non-confidential.
