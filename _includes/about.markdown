About
=====
My name is **Marco Guerri**, I was born in 1988 in Modena, Italy. I studied Computer Engineering 
at University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and I currently work at CERN, the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire
or European Council for Nuclear Research.

My daily job involves both software development and working with enterprise level hardware.
My team is responsible for managing the CPU and storage servers deployed in the CERN 
Data Centre in Geneva (Switzerland) and Budapest (Hungary) and for developing a
collection of software related to hardware monitoring and capacity management.
